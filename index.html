		<p>Beta Kappa Gamma (ΒKΓ) is a national Multicultural fraternity, our brotherhood transcends all 
		colors and creed. Established at the University of Texas at Austin (UT) on May 6, 1999 Beta Kappa 
		Gamma's objectives include providing service to the community through various philanthropic 
		activities, increasing awareness for world hunger relief, promoting academic scholarship, and 
		creating a strong bond of brotherhood within its ranks. Beta Kappa Gamma was founded by twelve 
		young men who came together with a single purpose - a vision of creating a timeless institution 
		to cultivate brotherhood, knowledge, leadership. </p>
		<br><br><br>
		<p class="lead">Mission Statement<br>Brotherhood + Knowledge = Growth</p>
		<p>Beta Kappa Gamma prides itself in its unique effort to promote growth as well as integration 
		within society. The primary goal and essential mission is to strengthen bonds between existing 
		peoples while becoming more active in the community. </p>

		<p class="lead">Philanthropy</p>
		<p>Beta Kappa Gamma has kept a strong focus on the community during its almost twelve years in 
		existence and will always continue to do so. Beta Kappa Gamma has worked with several large and 
		small-scale organizations that help out the community in many different ways. These organizations 
		range from children shelters to cancer research and prevention foundations to food banks, and much 
		more. It is one of the primary goals of Beta Kappa Gamma to continuously help out the community 
		from year to year and we look forward to being able to produce larger and more profound events as 
		we grow. <br>Specifically, the brothers of Beta Kappa Gamma have focused their philanthropy towards 
		helping underprivileged children with their Brothers Kollecting Gifts week in the Fall that raises 
		money for Christmas gifts to be given to disadvantaged children in the local community. During the 
		Spring semester we team up with Relay For Life to help raise money and fight Cancer. Across the 
		nation, the brothers of Beta Kappa Gamma time and again make an impact on the communities surrounding 
		their campuses as well as the global community with their philanthropic focus. </p>
